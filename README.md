## Description

Customers that regularly participate in exercise or want to learn about diets and exercise can do that with The Fit Kit. Fit Kit is a website that anybody can access. It is ready and available whenever and for whoever. Unlike other competitors, like Weight Watchers, customers can decide their diet. Not let someone pick their food out for them with the hopes they lose the weight. The use for this website would help a customer learn what to eat to help lose weight, build muscle, or do both. Along with proper exercise, customers can see results. We also want to make sure customers do not learn bad habits. This is especially common in any form of weightlifting. Bad technique will injure the customer more than it will help them. The Fit Kit website is an overall informative website that wants to make the customer healthier and happier. The overall feature will help our customers track their exercise and eating habits. Tracking these habits should help them make better choices and be happy with their overall progress.
